    <p style="padding: 0em;"><strong>20. October 2005</strong> - 
      We finally have an official windows installer ready.
      Download it <a href="http://download.berlios.de/supertux/supertux-0.1.3-setup.exe">here</a>.
      </p>
<p style="padding: 0em;"><strong>20. September 2005</strong> - 
      A few weeks ago, SuperTux 0.1.3 received an <a href="http://mac.softpedia.com/progClean/SuperTux-Clean-9049.html">award</a> 
      for not containing any adware, spyware or viruses. Apparently it's easier these days to point out software that does <i>not</i>
      contain malicious code... :-)
      </p>
<p style="padding: 0em;"><strong>18. September 2005</strong> - 
        About our decision to make OpenGL a requirement for SuperTux Milestone 2, please see
        <a href="http://cd.bromley.ac.uk/supertux/forums/viewtopic.php?id=106">this link</a>. There's also
        a poll <a href="http://home.arcor.de/firefrog/su1.html">here</a> where you can state wether or not
        you will be able to play milestone 2 if it requires OpenGL (please be honest!).
      </p>
<p style="padding: 0em;"><strong>18. September 2005</strong> - 
        Due to unbearable amounts of spam we received on the mailing list, we decided to close it for 
        non-subscribed people. If you don't want to subscribe you can still send a message to the list, but
        it will have to be approved by a moderator first, which means that it'll take a bit longer and you
        will receive an email saying that your message is waiting for approval. You can also send your email
        directly to one of the team members who can then forward it to the list.
        We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience but with all that spam we had no choice.
      </p>
<p style="padding: 0em;"><strong>21. August 2005</strong> - 
        The <a href="http://supertux.berlios.de/wiki/index.php/Download/Installation">download page</a> now has additional
        binary packages for SuperTux 0.1.3, including a version for MacOS X 10.3 or later as well as an (unofficial) Windows build.
      </p>
<p style="padding: 0em;"><strong>09. July 2005</strong> - 
        SuperTux 0.1.3 has been released! New features include a second Bonus Island with 28
        new levels as well as custom world map support and a few bugfixes.
        Get the source package at the <a href="http://supertux.berlios.de/wiki/index.php/Download/Installation">download section</a>,
        binary packages will follow soon.
        A compatible version of Flexlay with world map support is available from the
        Flexlay SVN repository; you can download it by using the following command:
        "svn checkout svn://svn.berlios.de/flexlay/branches/flexlay-0.0.2"
        A big "Thank you" goes out to everyone who contributed to this release!
      </p>
<p style="padding: 0em;"><strong>30. June 2005</strong> - 
        The level submission deadline for SuperTux 0.1.3 is over - the second Bonus Island
        will contain 20 new levels, four from the SuperTux Team and sixteen contributed by
        players. Expect a release around next week.
        For all of you waiting for milestone 2: We still have no idea when it'll be ready,
        but we are all putting a lot of our free time into it. There has already been quite
        some progress, and there's more to come.
      </p>
<p style="padding: 0em;"><strong>13. June 2005</strong> - 
        To (hopefully) keep you happy while waiting for milestone 2, we decided to release
        another Bonus Island featuring a bunch of new contributed and official levels. The
        webmaster of the <a href="http://cd.bromley.ac.uk/supertux/">SuperTux Fan Site</a>
        provided an assorted set of levels that have been submitted to his site to be
        included on Bonus Island 2. If you created a level that you would like to appear in
        the next release, <a href="mailto:supertux-devel@berlios.de">please send it to us</a>
        during the next two weeks.
      </p>
<p style="padding: 0em;"><strong>3. April 2005</strong> - 
        After a rather long break where everyone has been busy with other
	things, we are finally back on SuperTux. The main goals of milestone 2
	were discussed in an IRC meeting yesterday; the
        <a href="http://supertux.berlios.de/wiki/index.php/Meeting_log_(2005-04-02)">meeting log</a>
        is available on the
        <a href="http://supertux.berlios.de/wiki/">SuperTux wiki</a>.
      </p>
<p style="padding: 0em;"><strong>2. December 2004</strong> - 
        It looks like we have our first fansite. You can find it at
        <a href="http://cd.bromley.ac.uk/supertux/">SuperTux: The Fan Site</a>.
        It includes game information, tips, cheats and more.
