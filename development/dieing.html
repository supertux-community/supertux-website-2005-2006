      In MarioBros1 one went from being SuperMario/FireMario to being
      a small Mario to being a dead on the next enemy touch. Lives
      where limited, there where no continues. MarioAllStars later
      added the ability to restart from a given World.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      In MarioBros3 one lost only one ability at a time, so
      FireMario/RacoonMario &#8594; SuperMario &#8594; SmallMario
      &#8594; dead. SuperMarioWorld went the same as MarioBros3 but
      provided an additional extra-slot, that could host one extra and
      release it on request, thus restoring the abilities. Continues
      where provided per World, reset points in the world itself where
      provided by doors, that stayed open even after a continue. Reset
      points in the levels where not provided, since the levels where
      relativly short this wasn't a problem.
    </p>

    <p>
      Yoshis Island used a completly different concept, instead of
      having special abilites, Yoshis stays pretty much the same all
      the time (some items can allow Yoshi to spit fire and such, but
      these are eaten and lost after a short time, there are no
      permanent extras). On enemy contact BabyMario is released from
      Yoshi and floats around, he can be catched again, so Yoshi has
      pretty much unlimited energie if one manages to catch BabyMario
      in time.  Time counts down from max. 30 &#8594; to 0, up to 10
      energie points are automatically refreshed, the rest needs the
      collection of items. Progress was saved per level, going forward
      and backward to older levels is possible.
    </p>

    <p>
      Mario64 and MarioSunshine used the concept of energie. In
      Mario64 energie is easily recovered by simply jumping into
      water. In MarioSunshine energie is recovered by collecting
      coins(?). No reset points in normal levels, since levels where
      split in small puzzles that needs to be solved. The jump'n run
      levels had a reset point at half of the level.
    </p>

    <p>
      Falling into a hole in the ground leads to death in all Marios.
    </p>

    <p>
      The trend is after all to make dieing less fatal, loss of energy
      is easily recovered in most games, but requires a bit of
      work. Reset points are provided in addition. So the frustration
      is keep rather low. Progress is often saved per level now
      instead of per world, thus not forcing you to replay levels
      again and again. Lives are of not much use since Yoshis Island,
      they only limited the amount of times one can use a reset point
      in the level itself, world wise they have no effect.
    </p>

    <p>
      So how should dieing in SuperTux work? Keeping frustration low
      and the reset point frequent should be a goal, however it should
      not be made too easy (ie not providing a quick-save in the level
      itself). Saving on the worldmap should happen on a per level
      basis, not per world. Saving should be automatic, replaying
      levels should be possible. Reset points in the level should be
      provided, given that the levels are long enough. Enemy contact
      should cause the current extra to be lost.
